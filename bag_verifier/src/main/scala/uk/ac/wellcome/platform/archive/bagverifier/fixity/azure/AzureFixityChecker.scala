  //
  //      java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Did not observe any item or terminal
  //      signal within 60000ms in 'map' (and no fallback has been configured))
  //
  // I had the idea to shrink the size of the buffer by looking at AzCopy, a utility
  // for downloading large blobs from Azureâ€¦ as files.  The actual download code seems
  // to be in the Azure Blob Storage library for Go.  It downloads blobs 4MB at a time.
  // See https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/blob/48358e1de5110852097ebbc11c53581d64d47300/azblob/highlevel.go#L157-L175
  //
  // I went a bit bigger to reduce the number of requests we have to make, but
  // not by much.
  //
  // This bufferSize has successfully verified a blob which was 166 GiB in size.
