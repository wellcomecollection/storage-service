  # This gives us another layer of protection for the S3 buckets.
  #
  # In theory, every object is written once and exactly once:
  #
  #   - The AWS roles used by developers have an explicit Deny for
  #     PutObject or DeleteObject permissions, so we can't overwrite or
  #     remove objects from the buckets.
  #   - The replicators check for the existence of another object before
  #     writing anything to the bucket, and we have locking in place to
  #     ensure only one replicator is writing to a given prefix at a time.
  #
  # This means that there shouldn't be any extra cost to versioning, because
  # we're only ever storing a single version of each object.
  #
  # Enabling versioning gets us an extra level of protection, so if an object
  # is accidentally deleted, we can recover it.  We shouldn't rely on it, but
  # there's essentially no downside to having it enabled here.
