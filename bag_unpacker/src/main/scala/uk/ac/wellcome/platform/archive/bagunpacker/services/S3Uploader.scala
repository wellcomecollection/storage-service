  // Set bufferReadLimit
  // To prevent 'com.amazonaws.ResetException: Failed to reset the request input stream' being thrown.
  // (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/427)
  // (and https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform/issues/3481)
  //
  // If a transfer fails, the AWS SDK retries by rewinding the input stream to the 'mark' set in the buffer at the start.
  // The 'ReadLimit' determines how far the stream can be rewound, if it is smaller than the bytes sent before an error
  // occurs the mark will be invalid and a ResetException is thrown.
  //
  // When using a BufferedInputStream up to 'ReadLimit' bytes are stored in memory, and this must be (at least one byte)
  // larger than the PUT.  The buffer grows dynamically up to this limit.
  //
  // For multipart PUT requests the size must be larger than each PART.
  //
  // To prevent this exception a constant maximum size is set
  // assuming a maximum file of 600GB PUT as 10,000 multipart requests
  // = 60MB ~ 100MB read limit
  // this is a generous estimate and should be sufficient,
  // also given x10 concurrent streams = 10x100MB = 1GB memory overhead which we are comfortable with.
  // This change was tested to reproduce the error with a proxy that dropped traffic to simulate S3 network failure.
