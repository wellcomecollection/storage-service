  // This is a consequence of RFC 8493 ยง 3 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8493#section-3):
  //
  //      Every payload file MUST be listed in every payload manifest
  //
  // Note that the payload manifest might be empty, if there are no files in the bag,
  // which is why we ask the caller to supply a list of algorithms in use.
  //
  // This should already have been checked by the BagReader before creating
  // an instance of this class, so we can display useful errors to users.
  // This assertion is meant to prevent against programmer error in the
  // storage service code, not malformed bags uploaded by users.
